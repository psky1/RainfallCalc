How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).



INPUT

Get dimensions of footprint of roof in feet - both width and length

Get inches of rainfall.

PROCESSING

Multiply roof width by 12 and multiply roof length by 12
RoofRainfallCubicInches = width X length X rainfallInches

RoofRainfallGallons = RoofRainfallCubicInches / 231


OUTPUT

Display RoofRainfallGallons
